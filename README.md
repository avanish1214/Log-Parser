## Log Analyzer

Log Analyzer is a Python application designed to analyze logs generated by Petasense devices. The application aims to optimize battery life by parsing log entries, calculating module statistics, estimating battery life, and generating CSV reports. It supports both file-based and real-time log analysis.

## Features

- Parse log entries from a file or real-time input.
- Calculate total duration and module-specific statistics (max, min, avg durations).
- Estimate battery life based on module usage.
- Generate detailed CSV reports for analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries: re, csv, datetime, collections, json, argparse

## Usage

### Installing Requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### File-based Log Analysis
To analyze logs from a file, use the following command:
	`python log_analyzer.py file --logfile path/to/logfile.txt --jsonfile path/to/module_data.json
`
### Realtime Log Analysis
To analyze logs in real-time, use the following command:
`python log_analyzer.py realtime --jsonfile path/to/module_data.json
`

## JSON File Structure
The JSON file should contain the current consumption data for each module in the following format:
`{
    "module1": current1,
    "module2": current2,
    ...
}`
